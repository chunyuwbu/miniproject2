miniproject2
This project contains two models, using Tensorflow and keras in python to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) for recognizing images.

This project accomplished a small goal to train a model to recognize between sunflowers, roses and vegetables.

There is another system using pre-trained Inception-v3 model to train. It is more accurate and causes a better result of this one. The Inception-v3 model was trained on a powerful computer for weeks and it is absolutely more stable and efficient. 

The Inception-v3 pre-trained model python file is listed on the main page of miniproject2. It is a better way to do the training process.
